# inbox-reactrb-temp

This is a temporary repo before moving all code to a clean branched one.

## Structure

+ Each chapter has it's own folder `01`, `02`…
+ `README0.md` will be master / chapter 0
+ The result of the code when you finished `README0.md` can be found in `01`
+ `README1.md` will be chapter-1 branch readme found also in `01`.
+ The result of the code when you finished `README1.md` can be found in `02`
+ And so on…
